# CyMIRA_gene_classification
Plant genome gene categorization pipeline incorporating:
  -CyMIRA (http://cymira.colostate.edu)
  -Homology to Arabidopsis inferred by Orthofinder v2+ (https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder)
  -De novo targeting predictions from four different sub-cellular targeting prediction programs
    TargetP, iPSORT, Predotar, LOCALIZER
    
Required dependencies not included in this repository:
  -Orthofinder vâ‰¥2
  -TargetP
  -iPSORT
  -Predotar
  -LOCALIZER

Example job submission bash scripts have been provided for use (assuming SLURM job scheduler, but all programs should be able to be run locally on any linux-capable machine (run time might be affected though). TargetP appears to be particularly sensitive to computer architecture.

Please address queries/comments to Joel Sharbrough (jsharbro [at] gmail.com). If you can't get it to work, I'd be happy to assist and/or run it for you.
