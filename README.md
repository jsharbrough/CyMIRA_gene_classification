# CyMIRA_gene_classification
Plant genome gene categorization pipeline that incorporates data from CyMIRA (http://cymira.colostate.edu), homology to Arabidopsis inferred by Orthofinder v2+ (https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder), and de novo targeting predictions from four different sub-cellular targeting prediction programs (TargetP, iPSORT, Predotar, LOCALIZER).
